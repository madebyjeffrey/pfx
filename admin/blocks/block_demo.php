	    <p>Blocks are small chunks of content that sit beside your pages. At the moment you need to edit the blocks manually,
		You will find your blocks in the admin/blocks folder, we have included some examples to get you started.</p>
	    <p>To choose the blocks on this page head into the "settings" section within PFX, select "settings" on this page and choose your blocks. 
		We hope to improve the way blocks work in future versions. More information can be found in the documentation folder.</p>
